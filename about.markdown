## WHY WE DON'T LIKE 1-5 STAR RATINGS

As we’ve spent our fair share of time combing through reviews, we think there are 2 primary problems with ratings on sites like Yelp and Google:

1. The 1-5 star rating system is too simplistic and generic (5 stars is great, but based on what? You have to read lots of text to try to find out)
2. Reviews are already inherently subjective, but that subjective opinion is even less relevant if the people writing them aren’t clear about the point of view from which they're writing them (e.g., "the meat here is great" = not helpful to us)

*Our answer*: create a 100 point rating system that gives you an overall score for a restaurant as well as a score based on specific sub-categories. The category points are based on our own personal weighting of what we believe makes a good restaurant.

Our hope is that, regardless of whether our tastes and preferences line up nicely with yours, our category-based scoring and detailed reviews will give you a better guide on whether a restaurant (or a dish) is the right one for you.
