## What We Ordered
* Spicy Vegetarian Pizza
* Small Cheese Pizza

## Our Review
Ciceroâ€™s is a great vegetarian pizza joint, that favors folks who love thin crust with spicy toppings.

The pizza is always consistent in taste and crispiness, and the tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos always feel fresh. The tomatoes surprisingly do not make the pizza soggy.

The price is on par with other popular pizza places in the area.

Ordering happens up front and they call your name when your pizza is ready. The interior is bustling (at least when it was open before COVID). Be prepared to wait, the pizza takes 25 min to make.

For takeout orders, be sure to call before 6pm to schedule your order as most of the time after 6:15 the line is always busy and you cannot get through.
