## What We Ordered
Vegetarian Burrito – Pancho Villa Style

## Our Review
Margaritas Taqueria has the best (and spiciest) vegetarian burrito we have ever had!

The Pancho Villa style burrito has huge Serrano peppers that provide a huge kick, help back by the coolness of chopped cucumbers and tomatoes. Finally, the orange sauce liberally spread inside provides a creamy, tangy, roasted flavor that is hard to beat. The ingredients are always fresh and the burrito assembly is always consistent.

Begin a food truck, the value, speed of service, and friendliness of staff is top-notch, but the ambiance isn’t that great (its placed in a parking lot with minimal seating available)
