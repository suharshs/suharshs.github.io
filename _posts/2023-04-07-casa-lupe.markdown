## Our Review
Casa Lupe is our go-to Mexican sit-down restaurant. Its cozy feel and friendly service are what bring us back.

The staff has remained the same for the many years that we have come and seem to have a great relationship with all repeat diners.

Food is solid – both salsas are fresh and have some kick, the beans are flavorful, and portions are quite generous.

You can find better-tasting Mexican Food in the Bay Area, but on the whole, its hard to come by a better sit-down experience. Feels like family.
 
Pro-tip: if you like quacamole, get the Guacamole Tostada. The tostada comes completely smothered in guacamole and is an avocado lover’s dream.
