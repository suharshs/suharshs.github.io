## Our Review
Dusita Thai is one of our favorite Thai restaurant, for only one reason – the food is consistently delicious. There is even a dedicated vegetarian menu!

It’s hard to come by Thai food that has so much flavor that even if you get them at low levels of spice, you feel no need to add any sauce to it to make it taste good.

That being said, Dusita’s food is spicy. If you ask for “medium” spice level, they’ll ask “have you tried our Medium before?”. For dishes like curries and stir-fries the spice scale is reasonable. But be warned – “medium” level Papaya Salad is very spicy!

Due to COVID, most of our experiences have been take out, so our Service score reflects this. Pickup orders take a long and sometimes unpredictable amount of time. Recently pickup time estimates seem to be more accurate, but still be prepared to wait up to 90 min for a dinner pickup order. Don't even bother trying to call for a pickup order; you will either get no answer, an response with a 1 hour estimated wait, or once they just left the phone off the reciever after picking up.

Portions are reasonable and on par with the average Bay Area Thai eatery. The lunch combo value is exceptional though.
