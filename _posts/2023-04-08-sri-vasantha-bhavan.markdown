## Our Review
Sri Vasantha Bhavan is an excellent choice for a low-key South Indian eatery in the East Bay. 

The food was fresh, flavorful, and seemed to use high-quality ingredients. It was clear the owner took pride in the options they had to offer. We offhand mentioned that
we didn't want sweets in our Thalis and he went out of the way to offer many other things we could substitute.

Compared to other south indian eateries in the area, the value for the quantity of food was reasonable.

The ambiance is on par with most south indian places; loud clanging of pans, and lots of conversations going on. That being said, it was much less packed 
than some other joints (at least on a saturday afternoon).
