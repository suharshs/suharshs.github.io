## What We Ordered
Vegetable Ramen â€“ (sub spinach noodles with normal ramen noodles)

## Our Review
Ramen Izakaya Yu-gen has one of the best vegetarian ramens.

The base is vegetable broth although they have a disclaimer that they do not guarantee that the food is vegetarian. There are an assortment of free vegetables, two pieces of tofu, and an egg in the ramen so the meal ends up filling.

The spice level and temperature of ingredients can have some variance across experiences but the core flavor is always consistent.

The value and service of the food is OK compared to other places, there is a built-in gratuity and service can be slow when trying to get your check. Food service is very quick though.

The space is beautifully decorated and outdoor dining on Castro is always nice.
