## Our Review
Old Siam is our favorite thai place (also very underrated). We have been coming here for years: the food is always consistent, and the all-women staff are very friendly, especially as they get to know you. Even if you only come by a couple times, they will usually remember you.

The spice scale goes from mild, medium, hot, and then 1 - 10 *after* hot. We usually go for a 4.

The Roti is nice and flaky and less oily than other thai restaurants.

The curries are creamy but not overly thick.

The pad thai is not too sweet, and super-flavorful. It might be the best pad thai.

Ingredients are always fresh and they are very generous in the amount of tofu and vegetables included. Portions are also large, we usually end up with leftovers for one of us the next day.
